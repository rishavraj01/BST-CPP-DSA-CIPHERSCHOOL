<h1>Implementation of Binary Search Tree</h1>

This project is focused on implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C++. The BST class includes operations such as:<br>
~Insertion<br>
~Deletion<br>
~Searching<br>
~Traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)<br>

<h1>Overview</h1>
The project "Implementation of Binary Search Tree" focuses on creating a binary search tree data structure in C++ and implementing various operations like insertion, deletion, and searching on the tree.

<h1>Features & Functionalities</h1>
Implemented methods for insertion (insert), deletion (remove), searching (search), and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder).<br>
Insertion Operation: Allows inserting a new node into the BST while maintaining its properties (left child < parent < right child).<br>
Deletion Operation: Supports deletion of a node from the BST based on different cases: node has no children, node has one child, and node has two children.<br>
Search Operation: Enables searching for a key in the BST to determine if it exists in the tree.<br>

<h1>Technology Used</h1>
<h3>Programming Language: C++ <br>
IDE: Visual Studio Code </h3>

<h1>Usage of the program</h1>
Once the program is running, you can interact with the Binary Search Tree through a command-line interface (CLI). The program allows you to:<br>
Insert nodes into the BST<br>
Delete nodes from the BST<br>
Search for a node in the BST<br>
Traverse the BST (inorder, preorder, postorder)<br>
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform these operations.<br>

<h1>Sample Output</h1>
Binary Search Tree Operations: <br>
Insert<br>
Delete<br>
Search<br>
Traverse (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)<br>
<h2>Exit</h2><br>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
The "Implementation of Binary Search Tree" project shows how elements can be used for various purpose in Data Structuring. This code is implemented in C++.
