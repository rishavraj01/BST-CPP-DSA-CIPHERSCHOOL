*Implementation of Binary Search Tree*

This project is focused on implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C++. The BST class includes operations such as: /n
~Insertion
~Deletion
~Searching
~Traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)

*Overview*
The project "Implementation of Binary Search Tree" focuses on creating a binary search tree data structure in C++ and implementing various operations like insertion, deletion, and searching on the tree.

*Features & Functionalities*
Implemented methods for insertion (insert), deletion (remove), searching (search), and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder).
Insertion Operation: Allows inserting a new node into the BST while maintaining its properties (left child < parent < right child).
Deletion Operation: Supports deletion of a node from the BST based on different cases: node has no children, node has one child, and node has two children.
Search Operation: Enables searching for a key in the BST to determine if it exists in the tree.

*Technology Used*
Programming Language: C++
IDE: Visual Studio Code

*Usage of the program*
Once the program is running, you can interact with the Binary Search Tree through a command-line interface (CLI). The program allows you to:
Insert nodes into the BST
Delete nodes from the BST
Search for a node in the BST
Traverse the BST (inorder, preorder, postorder)
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform these operations.

*Sample Output*
Binary Search Tree Operations:
Insert
Delete
Search
Traverse (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
Exit

*Conclusion*
The "Implementation of Binary Search Tree" project shows how Data Structures work in computer science. This code is implemented in C++. It provides a comprehensive implementation of a binary search tree with essential operations required in real world scenario.
